  abstract = {Ionic liquids are room-temperature molten salts, composed mostly of organic ions that may undergo almost unlimited structural variations. This review covers the newest aspects of ionic liquids in applications where their ion conductivity is exploited; as electrochemical solvents for metal/semiconductor electrodeposition, and as batteries and fuel cells where conventional media, organic solvents (in batteries) or water (in polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cells), fail. Biology and biomimetic processes in ionic liquids are also discussed. In these decidedly different materials, some enzymes show activity that is not exhibited in more traditional systems, creating huge potential for bioinspired catalysis and biofuel cells. Our goal in this review is to survey the recent key developments and issues within ionic-liquid research in these areas. As well as informing materials scientists, we hope to generate interest in the wider community and encourage others to make use of ionic liquids in tackling scientific challenges.},

  abstract = {The inertial parameters of manipulator rigid-body loads and links have been automatically estimated as a result of gen eral movement. The Newton-Euler equations have been recast to relate linearly the measured joint forces or torques via acceleration-dependent coefficients to the inertial parame ters, which have then been estimated by least squares. Load estimation was implemented on a PUMA 600 robot equipped with an R TI FS-B wrist force-torque sensor and on the MIT Serial Link Direct Drive Arm equipped with a Barry Wright Company Astek wrist force-torque sensor. Good estimates were obtained for load mass and center of mass, and the forces and torques due to movement of the load could be pre dicted accurately. The load moments of inertia were more difficult to estimate. Link estimation was implemented on the MIT Serial Link Direct Drive Arm. A good match was ob tained between joint torques predicted from the estimated parameters and the joint torques estimated from motor cur rents. The match actually proved superior to predicted torques based on link inertial parameters derived by CAD modeling. Restrictions on the identifiability of link inertial parameters due to restricted sensing and movement near the base have been addressed. Implications of estimation accu racy for manipulator dynamics and control have been consid ered.},

The sensor is made of a hyperelastic silicone elastomer that contains embedded microchannels filled with conductive liquids. This is an effort of improving the previously reported soft sensors that uses a single liquid conductor. The proposed sensor employs a hybrid approach involving two liquid conductors: an ionic solution and an eutectic gallium-indium alloy. This hybrid method reduces the sensitivity to noise that may be caused by variations in electrical resistance of the wire interface and undesired stress applied to signal routing areas. The bridge between these two liquids is made conductive by doping the elastomer locally with nickel nanoparticles. The design, fabrication, and characterization of the sensor are presented.},

  abstract = {When performing eye surgery, surgeons traditionally rely on visual feedback through needle insertion to sense tissue. Particularly, in vitreoretinal surgery, the contact force exerted by a surgical robot to avoid damaging healthy tissue is very small and can be below that which a surgeon is able to sense. In this paper, we introduce the small frequency sliding perturbation observer (SFSPO), which is a technique for estimating the very small contact force exerted when the tip of a surgical tool of a 6-Degree of Freedom (DoF) eye surgery robot touches tissue. This contact force is estimated without using any force/torque sensor, and the small feedback force is amplified, meaning the surgeon can feel it as a large reaction force. Furthermore, during lengthy microscopic surgery procedures, surgeons can experience fatigue and tiredness due to the intense focus required. This may result in damage to healthy tissue due to sudden changes in manipulation and the exertion of excessive force. To avoid this problem, force and velocity limitation control is applied. Simulations are conducted, and the experimental results indicate that very small forces below the perception of the surgeon can be sensed using the SFSPO. We have estimated minimum force which is 0.001 N by using SFSPO which is underneath the perception of surgeon. The results also verify successful implementation of the force and velocity limitation control.},

  abstract = {To adapt to constantly changing environments and be safe for human interaction, robots should have compliant and soft characteristics as well as the ability to sense the world around them. Even so, the incorporation of tactile sensing into a soft compliant robot, like the Fin Ray finger, is difficult due to its deformable structure. Not only does the frame need to be modified to allow room for a vision sensor, which enables intricate tactile sensing, the robot must also retain its original mechanically compliant properties. However, adding high-resolution tactile sensors to soft fingers is difficult since many sensorized fingers, such as GelSight-based ones, are rigid and function under the assumption that changes in the sensing region are only from tactile contact and not from finger compliance. A sensorized soft robotic finger needs to be able to separate its overall proprioceptive changes from its tactile information. To this end, this paper introduces the novel design of a GelSight Fin Ray, which embodies both the ability to passively adapt to any object it grasps and the ability to perform high-resolution tactile reconstruction, object orientation estimation, and marker tracking for shear and torsional forces. Having these capabilities allow soft and compliant robots to perform more manipulation tasks that require sensing. One such task the finger is able to perform successfully is a kitchen task: wine glass reorientation and placement, which is difficult to do with external vision sensors but is easy with tactile sensing. The development of this sensing technology could also potentially be applied to other soft compliant grippers, increasing their viability in many different fields.},

This review aims to provide an overview of the collection of machine-learning methods used to enable a robot to learn from and imitate a teacher.

Here, a critical overview of soft robotic grippers is presented, covering different material sets, physical principles, and device architectures. Soft gripping can be categorized into three technologies, enabling grasping by: a) actuation, b) controlled stiffness, and c) controlled adhesion. A comprehensive review of each type is presented. Compared to rigid grippers, end-effectors fabricated from flexible and soft components can often grasp or manipulate a larger variety of objects. Such grippers are an example of morphological computation, where control complexity is greatly reduced by material softness and mechanical compliance. Advanced materials and soft components, in particular silicone elastomers, shape memory materials, and active polymers and gels, are increasingly investigated for the design of lighter, simpler, and more universal grippers, using the inherent functionality of the materials. Embedding stretchable distributed sensors in or on soft grippers greatly enhances the ways in which the grippers interact with objects. Challenges for soft grippers include miniaturization, robustness, speed, integration of sensing, and control. Improved materials, processing methods, and sensing play an important role in future research.},

In the simulation, the effect of each individual structural parameter was analyzed, to optimize the geometry to provide the largest gripping force without losing the advantage of flexible deformation. To verify the enhanced gripping capabilities of three gripping methods, the maximum mass of workpieces that could be gripped was measured. The geometry of the objects that could be gripped was also investigated. The modified gripper significantly improved the gripping weight by a factor of approximately 4--5 compared to the original finger structure, and was able to grip various workpieces, including one with an aspect ratio exceeding 10.

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a design method of a two-channel bilateral control system using an approach based on transfer function. The configuration of such a control system can be realized by designing a complementary sensitivity function. Compared with the conventional four-channel bilateral control, our system has better control performance and requires fewer communication channels. The proposed scheme can be extended to micro/macro bilateral control that changes the scaling ratio of the master to slave systems. The proposed bilateral control can be realized simply by using a simple controller. In order to compare performances of the proposed method and the conventional four-channel bilateral control, ordinary bilateral control and micro/macro bilateral control are performed by a simple experimental machine with a one-degree-of-freedom mechanism. We discuss the features of each method by comparing the transparency and operability of both methods.},

  abstract = {Object grasping is an important ability required for various robot tasks. In particular, tasks that require precise force adjustments during operation, such as grasping an unknown object or using a grasped tool, are difficult for humans to program in advance. Recently, AI-based algorithms that can imitate human force skills have been actively explored as a solution. In particular, bilateral control-based imitation learning achieves human-level motion speeds with environmental adaptability, only requiring human demonstration and without programming. However, owing to hardware limitations, its grasping performance remains limited, and tasks that involves grasping various objects are yet to be achieved. Here, we developed a cross-structure hand to grasp various objects. We experimentally demonstrated that the integration of bilateral control-based imitation learning and the cross-structure hand is effective for grasping various objects and harnessing tools.},

  abstract = {In robot assisted laparoscopic surgery using a commercialized robot, such as the da Vinci, surgeons have encountered problems, such as organ impairment, because they depend only on visual information. To solve these problems, a haptic system is required. Force feedback and a bilateral control system are essential for realizing a haptic teleoperation system. The use of a force/torque sensor for force feedback is difficult in a surgical robot instrument, but previous studies confirmed that the reaction force loaded on a surgical robot instrument can be estimated using a sliding perturbation observer (SPO)-based reaction force estimation method. This paper suggests a bilateral controller applying SPO based force estimation method to realize the possibility of a haptic function in a laparoscopic surgery robot system. In the suggested bilateral controller, the master control uses impedance control and the slave control uses a sliding mode control (SMC). A torque and force sensorless teleoperation system can be implemented using the suggested bilateral control structure through an experimental evaluation.},

  abstract = {Fine manipulation tasks, such as threading cable ties or slotting a battery, are notoriously difficult for robots because they require precision, careful coordination of contact forces, and closed-loop visual feedback. Performing these tasks typically requires high-end robots, accurate sensors, or careful calibration, which can be expensive and difficult to set up. Can learning enable low-cost and imprecise hardware to perform these fine manipulation tasks? We present a low-cost system that performs end-to-end imitation learning directly from real demonstrations, collected with a custom teleoperation interface. Imitation learning, however, presents its own challenges, particularly in high-precision domains: errors in the policy can compound over time, and human demonstrations can be non-stationary. To address these challenges, we develop a simple yet novel algorithm, Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT), which learns a generative model over action sequences. ACT allows the robot to learn 6 difficult tasks in the real world, such as opening a translucent condiment cup and slotting a battery with 80-90\% success, with only 10 minutes worth of demonstrations.

  abstract = {Deformable object manipulation (DOM) is a primary bottleneck for the real-world application of autonomous robots, requiring advanced frameworks for sensing, perception, modeling, planning, and control. When fragile objects such as soft tissues or fruits are involved, ensuring safety becomes the paramount concern, fundamentally altering the manipulation problem from one of pure trajectory optimization to one of constrained optimization and real-time adaptive control. Existing DOM methodologies, however, often fall short of addressing fragility constraints as a core design feature, leading to significant gaps in real-time adaptiveness and generalization. This review systematically examines individual components in DOM with a focus on their effectiveness in handling fragile objects. We identified key limitations in current approaches and, based on this analysis, discussed a promising framework that utilizes both low-latency reflexive mechanisms and global optimization to dynamically adapt to specific object instances.},

  abstract = {Integrating human and robot into a single system offers remarkable opportunities for creating a new generation of assistive technology. Having obvious applications in rehabilitation medicine and virtual reality simulation, such a device would benefit both the healthy and disabled population. The aim of the research is to study the kinematics and the dynamics of the human arm during daily activities in a free and unconstrained environment as part of an on-going research involved in the design of a 7 degree of freedom (DOF) powered exoskeleton for the upper limb. The kinematics of the upper limb was acquired with a motion capture system while performing a wide verity of daily activities. Utilizing a model of the human as a 7 DOF system, the equations of motion were used to calculate joint torques given the arm kinematics. During positioning tasks, higher angular velocities were observed in the gross manipulation joints (the shoulder and elbow) as compared to the fine manipulation joints (the wrist). An inverted phenomenon was observed during fine manipulation in which the angular velocities of the wrist joint exceeded the angular velocities of the shoulder and elbow joints. Analyzing the contribution of individual terms of the arm's equations of motion indicate that the gravitational term is the most dominant term in these equations. The magnitudes of this term across the joints and the various actions is higher than the inertial, centrifugal, and Coriolis terms combined. Variation in object grasping (e.g. power grasp of a spoon) alters the overall arm kinematics in which other joints, such as the shoulder joint, compensate for lost dexterity of the wrist. The collected database along with the kinematics and dynamic analysis may provide the fundamental understanding for designing powered exoskeleton for the human arm},
